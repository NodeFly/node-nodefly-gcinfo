# NodeFly Garbage Collection Inspector

- Since Windows can be tricky to compile Node extensions on,
we provide a [binary release branch](https://github.com/NodeFly/node-nodefly-gcinfo/tree/bin)
with pre-compiled versions of our inspector.
- We also have the pre-compiled module on npm as [nodefly-gcinfo](https://npmjs.org/package/nodefly-gcinfo)
- Either module is fine to use, they are source and compiled mirrors of each other
